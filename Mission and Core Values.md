## Create Something Worth Sharing
When we started Pop Pays, before quitting our jobs or raising any money, we sat down at a restaurant to talk about what we wanted Pop Pays to be. We wanted a question we could pass everything through to make sure we were staying true to what we wanted to build– a North Star. We scribbed it on a napkin: “Is it worth sharing?” 

Our mission fuels our product: we want the content that results from collaborations on our platform to be content that’s actually worth sharing. But it doesn’t end there. From the people we hire, to the designs we release, to the things we tweet, to the pitches we make, or the customer service emails we send, they have to be worth sharing. If it’s not worth sharing, it’s not worth doing.
 
Our company is built on things that are worth sharing, from our Creators to our service, and we’re committed to that standard. As a company, we need to believe that in an age of sharing, you can achieve more from doing one thing really well than doing a lot of things just OK.
 
The following Core Values point us back to the mission we’re working towards, and help us make the big and small decisions that guide our work, individually and as a team. They’re helpful guideposts to remember as we work together, but our Core Values can evolve as the Pop Pays team grows. 


# Core Values
 
## Our Mission Is Worth It
Joining the Pop Pays team means you believe in our mission, and you share our passion for it. Joining our team means that you’re here not just because startups are a good place to get a jump start on a career or a good investment. No matter how good someone is on paper, if a potential teammate can’t align with our mission, we can’t bring them on at the expense of our culture.

Joining our team means that you’re ready to focus on one goal, and ignore the distractions that might pull your focus. Believing our Mission is worth it means you’re committed to building something worth sharing. 

 
## The Journey Is Worth It
No matter how successful we feel, our work is never done. Prioritizing the journey means we want to continually improve. There’s no growth without a journey. Since we’re moving forward together, enjoy the process and the teammates on the journey with you. Life is short, and you shouldn’t be in a career that isn’t worth it to you. Have fun!

Overcoming obstacles is part of the journey, so we tackle issues together as a team. Instead of starting with assumptions or possible solutions, we have to start with a problem and work from there. Believing in our journey means we believe in iteration as part of the process. We can’t ship something worth sharing before trying a few things that don’t work. 

As we’ve learned, growth doesn’t always mean addition. Sometimes the journey looks like letting things go, simplifying, and being grateful for how you got here. 


## Our People Are Worth It
We acknowledge our people are our most important asset. People are a priority. To achieve our goals, our office community has to be a space where everyone and their ideas are respected and welcome. 

Wherever we go, we carry community with us. Anyone that comes into contact with our Pop Pays team deserves that same level of respect we give each other in the office. We treat customers, Creators, partners, investors, and even competitors just as well as we treat each other. 

We respect our Creators and Clients. There’s a reason we don’t call them “Users”: Creators and Client add value to our product. We understand the people who know what our customers need are the customers themselves. We listen to them to learn what to build for them, because people improve our product. 

When a Creator or Client is confused, it doesn’t mean the blame is on them; it means we found something we can improve on. People provide solutions. When we disagree with a teammate, we do it in a way that leads to solutions. 

We need people who grow our culture. We value diversity in team members, and look for people who can add to the team, not just people who can fit in.


## Our Conversations Are Worth It
We value communication, and want to keep getting better at it. When sharing with teammates we stay transparent, so our communication stays real. We respect everyone’s right to participate, and we want people who add to our conversations. Conversations happen when everyone is actively listening, instead of interrupting. Listening isn’t just hearing, it’s about being present.

We understand that not every conversation is going to be easy. Don’t avoid hard conversations; those are usually the most valuable ones. If you’re not enjoying your work, speak up for yourself, because we’re committed to helping everyone find their right place. Feedback is always encouraged, but assume the best intentions from the person delivering it. Your team is trying to help, not hurt.

Our conversations are important because our words have impact. The words that we use have a direct impact on our people, and their ability to accomplish our mission.


## You Are Worth It
Every team member was hired because we believe they add value to everyone else’s work. Since every team member has value, that value deserves to be developed. We want Pop Pays to be a place where you can grow. 

We believe everyone on our team is creative. Creativity isn’t exclusive to our network of  Creators; we look to teammates across departments for ideas and inspiration. 

We make plans, trusting that people will be successful, but allowing for mistakes. If and when it happens, you’re free to admit when you’re at fault, because we know you’re worth the growing pains. 

While our main goal is our mission, we also want to empower individual teammates to grow professionally and personally. We can’t grow unless you do. Setting and achieving goals is an important part of the growth that you do at Pop Pays, and they help us stay accountable. We’ll use all the resources we can to help you achieve those goals, because you’re worth it.
