# Travel and Expense Policy

## General
* Keep PopPays best interests in mind.
* Plan ahead to find balance between convenience and cost. 
* We'll need a receipt for each item you'll be expensing. Take photos of receipts to attach to your reports in Expensify. If you have an email receipt, please take a screenshot of it and attach it to your Expensify report.
* Clearly mark what the expense is for in Expensify - e.g. client lunch, Lyft to airport. Bonus points for writing it on the receipt itself before taking a picutre of it as well. This is most important for expenses involving clients or job candidates, which are categorized differently for tax purposes.
* Submit your expenses within 60 days of being incurred. Our Accounting team needs to close the books on months/quarters/years, so getting expenses that are older than 60 days can create a good amount of extra work.

## Accommodations and Per Diem Guidance
Note:
* Our per diem guidance is based on the General Services Administration’s (GSA) reimbursement guidelines for governmental employees. We’ve included these values for your reference.
* Travel to and from the airport/meetings and meals involving clients do not count against your per diem, but as always, please keep PopPays’ best interest in mind (sensing a theme here..).

#### Additional Things to keep in mind:
* It may make sense to book a hotel closer to a meeting/airport. If this puts you over the $$ amount for accommodations, reach out to the Expenses Team (expenses@popularpays.com) before booking and we can provide guidance on a case by case basis.
* If traveling to a market not listed above, send a note to the Expenses Team as soon as you think the trip is likely, so we can provide guidance on reimbursable amounts for accommodations and meals and incidentals.
* If you're having issues finding accommodations at or under the rates listed above (e.g. due to a conference in town), check in with the Expenses Team before booking, and we'll help you figure things out.

## Flights
* Use sites like Kayak, Expedia, or Google Flights to find flights that are both affordable and convenient
* If booking on your preferred airline to get points or status, please keep PopPays’ best interest in mind. If this causes your rate to be higher than other reasonable flight options, please check with the Expenses Team first. If it's a significant difference, we may ask that you cover the difference.
* If traveling with other teammates, try to fly out/in at similar times so travel expenses to/from airports can be minimized.
