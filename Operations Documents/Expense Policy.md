# Travel and Expense Policy

## General
Keep PopPays best interests in mind and use your discretion. Plan ahead to find balance between convenience and cost. 
 
## Flights
  
### Accommodations and Per Diem Allowance
Note: The General Services Administration (GSA) sets $ amounts for the max a company can reimburse their employees for accommodations and meals/incidentals for a given day. We’ve included their guidelines for reference. On the first and last day of travel, the GSA’s per diem maximums are discounted by 30%.
 
#### Chicago:
* Hotel: Crowne Plaza West Loop
* If you choose to stay elsewhere, you are eligible to be reimbursed up to the Crowne Plaza rate plus $20
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $40, assuming lunch in office  (GSA max $74)
* First/last day of travel: $40 per diem
 
#### NYC:
* Hotel: Arlo
* If elsewhere, you are eligible to be reimbursed up to the Arlo rate
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $60  (GSA max $74)
* First/last day of travel: $50 per diem
 
#### Los Angeles
* Hotel: $158 (GSA max)
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $60 (GSA max $74)
* First/last day of travel: $50 per diem
 
#### San Francisco
* Hotel: $267 (GSA max)
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $50 (GSA max $64)
* First/last day of travel: $40
 
If hotels are more expensive than the GSA max, please contact Coco.
  
#### Other markets:
* Give Coco a heads up ahead of time, so she can look at the GSA’s guidelines for accommodations and meals/incidentals for that city.
 
## Things that grind Coco’s gears:
* $200 team happy hours
* Expensive travel to/from airports/meetings (Chicago)
* Client dinners tough to monitor - use your discretion
 
#### :(
* Example: $13 breakfast, $15 lunch, $50 dinner
* Example: $17 breakfast, $36 lunch, $30 dinner
* $20 coffee in room, $30 for water, soap, shampoo
 
## Coco’s WIP:
1. Coco chatting with Concur and Egencia, but we think sticking with Expensify will be cheapest/easiest.
2. Looking into ‘Price to Beat’ feature on Expensify.
