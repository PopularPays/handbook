# Travel and Expense Policy

## General
Keep PopPays best interests in mind and use your discretion. Plan ahead to find balance between convenience and cost. 
 
## Flights
  
### Accommodations and Per Diem Allowance
Note: The General Services Administration (GSA) sets $ amounts for the max a company can reimburse their employees for accommodations and meals/incidentals for a given day. We’ve included their guidelines for reference. On the first and last day of travel, the GSA’s per diem maximums are discounted by 30%.
 
#### Chicago:
* Hotel: Crowne Plaza West Loop
* If you choose to stay elsewhere, you are eligible to be reimbursed up to the Crowne Plaza rate plus $20
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $40, assuming lunch in office  (GSA max $74)
* First/last day of travel: $40 per diem
 
#### NYC:
* Hotel: Arlo
* If elsewhere, you are eligible to be reimbursed up to the Arlo rate
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $60  (GSA max $74)
* First/last day of travel: $50 per diem
 
#### Los Angeles
* Hotel: $158 (GSA max)
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $60 (GSA max $74)
* First/last day of travel: $50 per diem
 
#### San Francisco
* Hotel: $267 (GSA max)
* Meals and incidentals per diem: $50 (GSA max $64)
* First/last day of travel: $40
 
If hotels are more expensive than the GSA max, please contact your Direct Manager. 
  
#### Other markets:
* Give Coco a heads up ahead of time, so she can look at the GSA’s guidelines for accommodations and meals/incidentals for that city.
 
#### Things that grind Coco’s gears:
* $200 team happy hours
* Expensive travel to/from airports/meetings (Chicago)
* Client dinners tough to monitor - use your discretion
 
:(
Example $13 breakfast, $15 lunch, $50 dinner (was ~$80, only $50 expensed)
Example: $17 breakfast, $36 lunch, $30 dinner
$20 coffee in room, $30 for water, soap, shampoo

Coco chatting with Concur and Egencia, but we think sticking with Expensify will be cheapest/easiest.

## Base Directories

At the base of every member of the Clef team’s directory, there should be 6 directories:

1. **[Clef Handbook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwj0rVaUQUXPNWI3SmlwMXRkTDQ&authuser=0)** -- a collection of documents about how we do things at Clef, which anyone can comment on

2. **Active Projects** -- All project folders will be shared globally in this folder

3. **Inactive Projects** -- projects which aren’t currently under development

4. **Resources** -- common resources which will be shared across projects -- like logo design resources, press clippings, etc.

5. **OKRs** -- everyone at Clef’s objectives and key results.

6. **[Your Name]** -- every employee should have their personnel folder in the root directory with contracts, offer letters, etc. inside (shared only with you)

## Creating New Projects

When a new project is started, a folder should be created with the format:

	**Project Name**

in the Active Projects folder so that it will be shared with everyone else on the team.

When the project is complete or paused, it should be moved to the Inactive Projects folder and labeled with the date when it was archived with the format:

**YYYY-MM Project Name**

The current structure doesn’t have a lot of built-in support for teams, since each project is autonomous. This will probably need to be fixed later as we grow and divide our functions into teams.
