# Two-Year, Two Weeks

After two years of working at Pop Pays, we provide a gift as a celebration for hard work and an encouragement to take some time off to explore.

We now do this in the way of granting two weeks of paid leave and $1,750 bonus towards any experience. So whether you prefer to visit a new continent, take your family to a local spot, try a cooking class or yoga retreatâ€“ or just have a "staycation"- this is time for our teammates to relax and explore. The monetary bonus is taxable and may be less than the original value.

Hopefully we all come back from our time off with new perspectives; we encourage you to take some photos and share your experience with us.

Please give your manager at least 1 month of notice before taking your trip, and try to plan it around what works best for your individual team.
