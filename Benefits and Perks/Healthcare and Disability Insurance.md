# Healthcare and Insurance

Popular Pays wants to make sure everyone feels happy, healthy, and that they and their loved ones are taken care of, so itâ€™s important that we offer our employees great medical coverage and disability insurance.

We offer medical, dental, and vision coverage at Popular Pays for employees and their dependents. Through Gusto, many options are available to all employees, and Popular Pays contributes 70% of the cost for all employees. All employees are eligible for coverage on the first of the month of their hire date. These policies are all managed through Gusto, which is where you can find more details about the plans, costs, and coverage.
