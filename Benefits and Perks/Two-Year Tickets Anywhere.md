# Two-Year, Two Weeks

After 2 years of working at Pop Pays, we got in the habit of gifting our teammates two plane tickets anywhere in the world as a celebration for their hard work and an encouragement to take some time off to explore. 

To make it fair for all, we now do this in the way of granting two weeks of paid leave and $1,750 towards any experience, so whether you prefer to visit a new continent, take your family to a local spot, try a cooking class or yoga retreatâ€“ or just have a "staycation"- this is time for our teammates to relax and explore. 

Hopefully we all come back from our time off with new perspectives; we encourage you to take some photos and share your experience with us.

Please give your manager at least 1 month of notice before taking your trip, and try to plan it around what works best for your individual team.
