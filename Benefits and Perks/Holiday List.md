# Observed Holiday List 2019
With manager approval and enough of a heads up for planning sake, teammates at Popular Pays are free to work from home as they wish (see [Working Remotely](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Working%20Remotely.md)) or take personal days as they see fit, but there are a few days where the office will be officially closed and the team is expected and encouraged to rest:
