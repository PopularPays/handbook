# Observed Holiday List 2018
Teammates at Popular Pays are free to work from home as they wish (see [Working Remotely](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Working%20Remotely.md)) or take personal days as they see fit, but there are a few days where the office will be closed, we will not be providing lunch service, and the team is expected and encouraged to rest:
