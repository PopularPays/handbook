# Two-Year Ticket Anywhere

After 2 years of working at Pop Pays, we gift our teammates two plane tickets anywhere in the world. To make it fair for all, we do this in the way of granting $1,750 towards any travel expense, so if you prefer to take your family to a local spot, you can do that as well. 

The main goal is to celebrate our teammates, to give them a chance to explore the world at large, and to bring back new perspectives to the team when they return. The world is only getting more global. 

Please give your manager at least 1 month of notice before taking your trip, and submit your receipts for the travel via Expensify. 

Your $1,750 travel retainer can cover things like hotels and food, and if there's a balance remaining when you get back, you will be bonused out 1/2 of the remainder (with the company keeping the other 1/2).
