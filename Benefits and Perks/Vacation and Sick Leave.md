# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Popular Pays, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), we offer unlimited time off. 

We try to hire teammates who use that policy responsibly, and we try not to add unnecessary rules, but the downside of unlimited PTO is that some people don't actually use it!

To ensure people are getting appropriate breaks, we recommend that each teammate take at least 2 weeks off, with at least 1 of those weeks being continuous.

Employees should schedule their vacations, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.

We also do not track sick leave, but you are encouraged to stay at home if you feel you might be coming down with something. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with their manager about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.
