# New Parent Leave

Popular Pays offers 12 weeks (3 months) of paid leave for all full time employees, regardless of gender or sexual identity, after the birth or adoption of a child. This time is for the new parent to welcome the newborn or newly adopted child or children into their home and family. The leave should be taken within a year after the birth or adoption of the child.

Employees should give the rest of the team as much notice as possible before they take new parent leave, though there is no requirement for how far in advance notification needs to be given. Parenthood can be unexpected and sensitive, but the more that a team can anticipate the absence, the easier it will be to handle.

In the case of the employee being a seller, in addition to their base salary, they will be eligible to receive the commission on all closed business and all outstanding proposals that close while they are on New Parent Leave. Commission resulting from a proposal that goes out after the start of New Parent Leave will go to the individual covering that account. Upon return from New Parent Leave, commission for all new proposals will resume with the returning seller. Management reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy when warranted.

Paid time off of any kind, including New Parent Leave, does not accrue additional paid time off in the form of vacation days, sick days, or time towards sabbatical. For instance, an employee who has worked for Popular Pays for 4 years will be eligible to take a sabbatical after 1 more year of work. If they took 12 weeks of new parent leave, when they returned they would still have 1 full year of work before they were eligible for their sabbatical.
