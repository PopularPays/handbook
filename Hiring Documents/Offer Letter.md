Welcome to Popular Pays, **FIRST_NAME**!

We're excited to extend an official offer for you to join the Popular Pays team as **a/the TITLE**. This offer letter will go over the basics of working at Pop Pays, but there are a lot more details in our [Employee Handbook](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook). If you have any questions that aren’t in this letter or the handbook, please let me know.

We'd like to offer a starting salary of **SALARY** per year combined with **OPTIONS** shares of stock options of Popular Pays’s common stock. There are **OUTSTANDING SHARES** shares of Popular Pays common stock outstanding, and your shares will vest over four years (with a one year cliff).

Equity at startups is complicated, so we have a [Guide to Your Equity](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Guide%20to%20Your%20Equity.md) that explains how options are issued, exercised, and what they might be worth if Popular Pays is successful.

The best perk of working at Pop Pays is working with stellar teammates, but you’re also entitled to all of the benefits that apply to you from our benefits plan. These currently include:

* [Healthcare, Dental, Vision](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Healthcare%20and%20Disability%20Insurance.md)

* [Short and Long Term Disability Insurance](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Healthcare%20and%20Disability%20Insurance.md)

* [A Flexible Vacation Policy](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Vacation%20and%20Sick%20Leave.md)

* [Holidays](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md)

* [A 2 month paid sabbatical every 5 years working at Popular Pays](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Sabbatical.md)

* [3 months paid new parent (maternity/paternity) leave](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/New%20Parent%20Leave.md)


The benefits we offer will adapt to the team’s needs over time and we evaluate and adjust compensation at the beginning of each year.

This position is full-time, so you should not take any other jobs without talking to us first. It’s also important that you avoid any work (paid or free) that interferes with your responsibilities at Popular Pays or that might create a conflict of interest (like helping out or investing in a competitor or preparing to compete with Popular Pays) unless Popular Pays approves it in advance.

Popular Pays is an "at-will" employer, which means that both you and Popular Pays have the right to stop working together at any time, with or without advance notice, and for any reason (or for no reason). We also reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of employment including your position, pay, and benefits offered depending on the growth and needs of the company.

Our [Employee Handbook](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook) goes over the general policies and practices for working at Popular Pays. This letter is specific to you and it supersedes the handbook if they conflict -- otherwise, the handbook is the authority on working at Popular Pays.

But this letter doesn’t mean anything unless you sign it! And before this takes legal effect, you’ll need to fill out our [Confidential Information and Assignment](https://drive.google.com/a/popularpays.com/file/d/0B1pZ_Vm_hATsR1lSbFVjQkNkUzA/view?usp=sharing) as well as an Employement Agreement that will be provided to you. You will also need to establish your identity and authorization to work in the country.

It has been great getting to know you through the interview process. The whole Pop Pays team is convinced that you’re the right person for this job, and we can’t wait to work with you!
