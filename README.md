# Our Handbook

At Popular Pays, we’re working to build a company worth sharing. We decided to use Clef's open-sourced template for a company handbook so that we can share our own thoughts with the world on how we want to run our company. 

Feedback and suggestions are welcome; this is a work in progress that we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.

If these thoughts on how to run a company sound like a place where you want to work, check out our jobs postings on our [AngeList Page](https://angel.co/popular-pays).
