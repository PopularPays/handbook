# Policy Changes
_Note that we have left a lot of the original Clef policies in this section; Pop Pays will review as a team and decide on our own processes at the next quarterly team meeting._


We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies. 

## Platforms and Tools

We’re using several different tools and platforms to collect feedback and discuss the handbook. I’d like to codify the way we’re using them now, and then adapt as we find new ways to use them -- here’s how I see that now:

### Github

The handbook is hosted on Github, and anyone with a Github account can make an issue or open a pull request. This is an important home for the project, and we want to encourage and reward participation. We should respond to issues and comments here and use the edits in pull requests when they’re appropriate. 

However, our internal processing does not need to happen on Github. Anyone should feel free to post their thoughts on Github, but there are a lot of sensitive topics that we’ll want to discuss internally. When we make changes, they should be merged on Github and we should explain our rationale there, but we don’t need to rehash the whole conversation.

Github is a tool that the technical members of our team will already need to get familiar with, but special consideration should be taken to make sure our non-technical teammates have accounts and understand how to participate there.


### Slack #handbook

This channel is a good place for us to comment on policy changes asynchronously. Any questions, concerns, ideas, or discussion about our handbook can go here. If a conversation seems particularly interesting, we'll document it in Google docs or in a Github issue for future reference.

## Quarterly Meetings

We will aim to review the policies each quarter as a team; regular review will make sure that issues don’t stagnate, and any team member is welcome to create proposals or contribute to research on policies that they’re interested in.


## Merging

After changes have been proposed, discussed, and resolved, we will merge them into the handbook. 

## Adoption

Everyone at Pop Pays should sign an [Acknowledgement of Receipt for the Employee Handbook](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Acknowledgment%20of%20Receipt.md), but any change to these documents need to be acknowledged by every employee. Most companies do this on each employee's first day, and then have employees sign another acknowledgement whenever they make a change (because they're rare).

Because we want these policies to constantly improve, we will merge changes as they appear. To make enforcing policy clear and unambiguous, we will adopt the changes at the beginning of each year. We will use milestones on Github to mark these canonical versions of the handbook. 

Every employee will need to sign an [Acknowledgement of Receipt of Changes to the Employee Handbook](https://github.com/PopularPays/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Acknowledgment%20of%20Receipt%20of%20Changes.md) each year, which may not scale as we grow to more employees.
